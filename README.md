# Problem Statement

This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of classifying customer support emails. The primary objective is to automatically predict the appropriate subject line for an email based on its body and existing subject. This task is framed as a multi-class text classification problem, where the model will learn to categorize emails into predefined subject categories.

# Dataset Overview

The dataset, named `ai engineer dataset.csv`, contains 20 entries and 4 columns, providing information about customer support emails. Below is a summary of the dataset's structure:

| Column Name | Description | Data Type |
|---|---|---|
| `sender` | The email address of the sender. | Object (String) |
| `subject` | The subject line of the email. | Object (String) |
| `body` | The main content of the email. | Object (String) |
| `sent_date` | The date and time the email was sent. | Object (String) |

## Class Distribution

The 'subject' column, which serves as our target variable for classification, contains 9 unique categories. The distribution of these subjects across the dataset is as follows:

| Subject | Count |
|---|---:|
| Help required with account verification | 4 |
| General query about subscription | 3 |
| Immediate support needed for billing error | 2 |
| Urgent request: system access blocked | 2 |
| Critical help needed for downtime | 2 |
| Question: integration with API | 1 |
| Support needed for login issue | 2 |
| Request for refund process clarification | 1 |
| Query about product pricing | 2 |

This distribution highlights a class imbalance, where some subject categories have significantly more instances than others. This is a common challenge in machine learning, as models trained on imbalanced datasets may become biased towards the majority classes, leading to poor performance in predicting minority classes. Addressing this imbalance through techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or using appropriate evaluation metrics will be crucial for developing a robust classification model.
